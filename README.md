# Feedback Survey

## Description

_Duration: 5-6 hours_

This project allowed me to showcase my understanding of react/redux flow with usage of CRUD and Axios to create a feedback survey.

This feedback survey has three questions; How are you feeling?, How well are you understanding the content?, and How well are you being supported? along with an optional Any comments you want to leave?.

I struggled with the client side post. It was not posting it to the database. However, with some help from my classmates, we figured out the errors. Another spot I struggle with is CSS styling.

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- Postgres

## Installation

1. Create a database with provided SQL in `data.sql` file.
2. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.

3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

If package.jason does not have react, redux, and logger:
1. Run `npm install redux@4 react-redux@7`
2. Run `npm install redux-logger@3`
